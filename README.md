# ClusterwiseJICA_v2

This project is the implementation for the Clusterwise J-ICA model including the simulation study scripts.

## New features

Based on the original Clusterwise J-ICA model, we mainly improve the fixed component number limitation.

* Varying the component number across clusters;

* Apply the VAF threshold rule and CHull to calculate the component number;

* Update the Tucker calculation method, for the situation when sources number larger than 8 apply a faster but not so precise calculation method.
